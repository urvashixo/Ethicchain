  # Fix Merchant RLS Policies for Custom Authentication

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing RLS policies that depend on auth.uid()
    - Create new policies that work with custom authentication
    - Allow public read access for verified merchants
    - Allow authenticated users to insert/update their own merchant data

  2. Policy Updates
    - Public read policy for all users
    - Insert policy for creating merchant profiles
    - Update policy for merchant owners
    - Select policy for merchant owners

  Note: Since we're using custom authentication without Supabase Auth,
  we need to adjust policies to work without auth.uid()

-- Allow anyone to insert merchant data (we'll validate user_id in the application)

-- Allow updates to merchant data (we'll validate ownership in the application)

-- Allow deletion of merchant data (we'll validate ownership in the application)
